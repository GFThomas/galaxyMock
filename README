# galaxyMock

\`galaxyMock\` is a toolset to create a self-consistent model of a galaxy's stellar distribution, incorporating multiple stellar components, and to transform it into a realistic observed mock galaxy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x is required.
- The installation script will automatically install any required Python packages.

## Installation

To install \`galaxyMock\`, simply run the following command in your terminal:

\`\`\`bash
./install.sh
\`\`\`

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following files and directories:

- **\`make_model.py\`**: Generates a realistic stellar distribution model for a galaxy.
- **\`make_mock.py\`**: Projects the stellar model onto the sky and creates an observed mock galaxy, resembling real observational data.
- **\`/iso/\`**: Contains isochrones from the Padova stellar library. Additional isochrone sets can be added to this folder as needed.
- **\`examples/\`**: Contains example files that demonstrate how to use the package:
  - **\`Sculptor_absolute.fits\`**: An example Sculptor-like galaxy model, based on *Arroyo-Polonio et al. 2025*.
  - **\`mock.fits\`**: The corresponding mock, designed to resemble Gaia DR3 observational data.
- **\`params.ini\`**: Configuration file that is used to set parameters for generating the model and mock galaxy.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the tools in \`galaxyMock\`:

### 1. **Generate a Galaxy Model**

You can use the \`make_model.py\` script to generate a realistic stellar distribution model of a galaxy. This will require modifying the \`params.ini\` configuration file to set the parameters for the galaxy model, such as stellar components, mass, age, etc.

**Example command to generate the model:**

\`\`\`bash
python make_model.py --config params.ini
\`\`\`

This command reads the \`params.ini\` file and creates a stellar model, which will be saved in a file like \`Sculptor_absolute.fits\` (as per the example).

### 2. **Create a Mock Observation**

After generating a stellar model, you can use the \`make_mock.py\` script to project the model onto the sky and generate a mock observation. This will simulate real-world data, such as what might be observed by Gaia.

**Example command to generate the mock:**

\`\`\`bash
python make_mock.py --model examples/Sculptor_absolute.fits --output examples/mock.fits
\`\`\`

This will take the galaxy model \`Sculptor_absolute.fits\` and project it into an observed mock, saved as \`mock.fits\`. This mock data will have the characteristics of a real-world observation, such as Gaia DR3.

### 3. **Example Files**

- **\`examples/Sculptor_absolute.fits\`**: This file contains an example Sculptor-like galaxy model, based on *Arroyo-Polonio et al. 2025*. This file was generated using the parameters from \`params.ini\`.
- **\`examples/mock.fits\`**: This is the mock observation corresponding to the Sculptor galaxy model, generated to simulate Gaia DR3 observations.

You can modify the parameters in the \`params.ini\` file and re-run the scripts to generate different models and mocks as needed.
